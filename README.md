# Introduction to C Programming

The main purpose of this repository is to show examples and exercises taken from the great (at least for me) book
"Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures" by Y. Daniel Liang bu adapted to the C programming language.

Simpy because C is a fun language I think :)
